Permissions define the actions a user can perform on a logical database. By default, no permission are given to a newly created user, except for the initial user created during the instance configuration (which is granted all permissions). 
But Managed Databases allows you to fine tune this to fit your needs and ensure your data security.

## Set permissions for a new user

During user creation, the permissions panel can be accessed through the top tab menu. 
For more information see the [add users how to](/database/how-to/add-users/)

<Message type="note">

Permissions are applied on existing objects **at the moment the configuration is set**, and not applied to any object created afterward. 
Permissions are automatically set to "**Custom**" when the database structure was modified after the permission was set. "**Custom**" means the initial permission is partially applied.
